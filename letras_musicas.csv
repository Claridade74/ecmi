taylor swift,cruel summer,"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

""I love you,"" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

""I love you,"" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

taylor swift,love story,"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-

You say hello, little did I know...



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-

And I was crying on the staircase-

begging you, ""Please don't go...""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.



So I sneak out to the garden to see you.

We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-

So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.

Oh, Oh.



Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -

but you were everything to me-

I was begging you, ""Please don't go""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes-



Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.

This love is difficult, but it's real.

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Oh, Oh.



I got tired of waiting.

Wondering if you were ever coming around.

My faith in you was fading-

When I met you on the outskirts of town.

And I said...



Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.

I keep waiting, for you but you never come.

Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...



Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.

I love you, and that's all I really know.

I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

taylor swift,red,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind
Passionate as sin, ended so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn

So bright just before they lose it all



Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

But loving him was red

Loving him was red



Touching him is like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you

Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out love could be that strong



Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

But loving him was red

Oh red burning red



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go

But moving on from him is impossible

When I still see it all in my head



Burning red!

Darling it was red!



Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

Cause loving him was red yeah yeah red

We're burning red



And that's why he's spinning round in my head

Comes back to me burning red

Yeah yeah

luisa sonza,sagrado profano,"Paroles de la chanson Sagrado Profano par Luísa Sonza
[Luísa Sonza]
Dirijo sozinha pela tua rua
Deitada na cama com a camisa tua
Mania de mim
Só nós dois enfim
Fim de tarde em Tom Rosé
Dá vontade de beber
Mais um trago de você
Faz fumaça pra aquecer

[Luísa Sonza]
Me olha e me encara, eu sou tua caça
Me engole e me encaixa, pode me comer
Pode me fu , ah
Pode me 


[Luísa Sonza, KayBlack]
Me encontra em todo mundo
Procura e me destrincha a fundo
Me diz qual amor não é confuso
Minado, inseguro
Ciúme de um fatídico segundo
Sagrado amor profano
Impuro amor profundo, yeah, eh-eh

[KayBlack]
Se a gente for a fundo mesmo
Pra te recordar que eu quis enfrentar
Todo esse sentimento confuso
Minado e inseguro
Como um mergulho raso
Buscando algo profundo, yeah, yeah, yeah

[KayBlack]

Não que eu seja inseguro, mas
'Cê nem me deu confiança
Eu tentei preservar o futuro em nós
Vai e vem nessa distância
E as lembranças só afetam mais
Fim de tarde nos lençóis
Bateu saudade de você sem
Sentada na cama com a minha peita branca
Me beija, me arranha, pede pra eu, ah-ah-ah
Pede pra eu fazer, pra satisfazer
O seu prazer na cama
Anoiteceu, o quarto entra em chama
E é você quem chama e eu não vou negar que
Depois das briga' eu te desejo mais, mas
Quero te ouvir falar

Uh, ah
Eu vou levar minhas cachorrinhas pra curtir no pet shop
Desfilando, patricinha, porque sou uma artista pop
Meu nariz empinadinho, não me rele, não me toque
Sou mimada e correria, cachorra de grande porte (Rawr)
Temos pedigree, coleira cara
Meu perfume caro atiça os faro dos vira-lata

Eu e minhas cachorras au-au, dá a patinha deita e rola, hahahaha

Insuportável, inadestrável, essa é minha BFF
Cadela número dois é a Britney Bitch
Ela é mandraca, nunca dá a pata
Essa é a Dudinha, a número três

Minha gata pirada, de quatro ela vem

Folia pra mim, me arriscar no amor
Apostar na incerteza, pular de onde for
De novo, meu amor
Diziam pra mim que essa moda passou
Que monogamia é papo de doido
Mas pra mim é uma honra ser uma cafona
Pra esse povo

Me pinto pra disfarçar
Rebusco palavras pra te encantar
Invento uma moda, faço bossa nova
Meu futuro no Rio será, mm

Chico, se tu me quiseres
Sou dessas mulheres de se apaixonar
Pode fazer a sua fumaça, o Bar da Cachaça vai ser nosso lar

E, Chico, se tu me quiseres
Debato política, tomo o teu partido
E se for pra repartir o amor, que reparta comigo, mm

u2,beautiful day,"The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town


You're out of luck

And the reason that you had to care

The traffic is stuck

And you're not moving anywhere





You thought you'd found a friend

To take you out of this place

Someone you could lend a hand

In return for grace





It's a beautiful day

Sky falls, you feel like

It's a beautiful day

Don't let it get away





You're on the road

But you've got no destination

You're in the mud

In the maze of her imagination





You love this town

Even if that doesn't ring true

You've been all over

And it's been all over you





It's a beautiful day

Don't let it get away

It's a beautiful day





Touch me

Take me to that other place

Teach me

I know I'm not a hopeless case





See the world in green and blue

See China right in front of you

See the canyons broken by cloud

See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night

See the oil fields at first light

And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth

After the flood all the colors came out





It was a beautiful day

Don't let it get away

Beautiful day





Touch me

Take me to that other place

Reach me

I know I'm not a hopeless case





What you don't have you don't need it now

What you don't know you can feel it somehow

What you don't have you don't need it now

Don't need it now

Was a beautiful day",rock
