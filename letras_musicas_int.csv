Taylor Swift,Cruel Summer,"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



Killing me slow, out the window

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I'm not buying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)



So cut the headlights, summer's a knife

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know



Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

""I love you,"" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

He looks up, grinning like a devil



And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

No rules, unbreakable heaven

But ooh, whoa oh

It's a cruel summer

With you



I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)

Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I screamed for whatever it's worth

""I love you,"" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

Taylor Swift,Love Story,"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-

You say hello, little did I know...



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-

And I was crying on the staircase-

begging you, ""Please don't go...""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.



So I sneak out to the garden to see you.

We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-

So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.

Oh, Oh.



Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -

but you were everything to me-

I was begging you, ""Please don't go""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes-



Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.

This love is difficult, but it's real.

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Oh, Oh.



I got tired of waiting.

Wondering if you were ever coming around.

My faith in you was fading-

When I met you on the outskirts of town.

And I said...



Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.

I keep waiting, for you but you never come.

Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...



Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.

I love you, and that's all I really know.

I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

They never see it comin'

What I do next

This is how the world works

You gotta leave before you get left



I can feel the flames on my skin

Taylor Swift,Red,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind
Passionate as sin, ended so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn

So bright just before they lose it all



Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

But loving him was red

Loving him was red



Touching him is like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you

Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out love could be that strong



Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

But loving him was red

Oh red burning red



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go

But moving on from him is impossible

When I still see it all in my head



Burning red!

Darling it was red!



Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

Cause loving him was red yeah yeah red

We're burning red



And that's why he's spinning round in my head

Comes back to me burning red

Yeah yeah



Cause love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street",pop

Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town


You're out of luck

And the reason that you had to care

The traffic is stuck

And you're not moving anywhere





You thought you'd found a friend

To take you out of this place

Someone you could lend a hand

In return for grace





It's a beautiful day

Sky falls, you feel like

It's a beautiful day

Don't let it get away





You're on the road

But you've got no destination

You're in the mud

In the maze of her imagination





You love this town

Even if that doesn't ring true

You've been all over

And it's been all over you





It's a beautiful day

Don't let it get away

It's a beautiful day





Touch me

Take me to that other place

Teach me

I know I'm not a hopeless case





See the world in green and blue

See China right in front of you

See the canyons broken by cloud

See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night

See the oil fields at first light

And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth

After the flood all the colors came out





It was a beautiful day

Don't let it get away

Beautiful day





Touch me

Take me to that other place

Reach me

I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't know you can feel it somehow

What you don't have you don't need it now

Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine

I don't know why

Keep making me laugh,

Try to have fun in the meantime



Come and take a walk on the wild side

Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

You like your girls insane

Choose your last words

This is the last time

Cause you and I, we were born to die



Lost but now I am found

I can see but once I was blind

I was so confused as a little child

Tried to take what I could get

Scared that I couldn't find

All the answers, honey



Don't make me sad, don't make me cry

Sometimes love's not enough when the road gets tough

[Dan Reynolds]
Look out for yourself

[Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[ Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us


[Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on thе wall as you'rе prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the namеs that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic


[ Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

[Dan Reynolds & JID]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look, okay

[JID]
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me

I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin'
They wanted static with precision
I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sacking, pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up

Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

[Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy

All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone...
I got that sunshine in my pocket

Got that good song in my feet

I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops

I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

Under the lights when everything goes

Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

When we move, well, you already know

So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance

A feeling good, good, creeping up on you

So just dance, dance, dance, come on

All those things I should do to you

But you dance, dance, dance

And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing



I can't stop the feeling

Ooh, it's something magical

It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on

Just know that I'm always

Parallel on the other side

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

Just put your hand on the glass

I'm here tryin' to pull you through

You just gotta be strong



Cause I don't wanna lose you now

I'm lookin' right at the other half of me

The vacancy that sat in my heart

Is a space that now you hold

Show me how to fight for now

And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out

You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror

My mirror staring back at me

I couldn't get any bigger

With anyone else beside me

And now it's clear as this promise

That we're making

Two reflections into one

Cause it's like you're my mirror

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me



Aren't you somethin', an original

Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample

And I can't help but stare, cause

I see truth somewhere in your eyes

I can't ever change without you

You reflect me, I love that about you

And if I could, I

Would look at us all the time

Tomorrow's a mystery

Keep your eyes on me

Baby, keep your eyes on me



Cause I don't wanna lose you now

To touch your lips, to hold you near

When you say your prayers try to understand

When he says the words you've been needing to hear

I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing

We're just friends, what are you saying?

Say there's another and look right in my eyes

My first love broke my heart for the first time

And I was like...

I thought you'd always be mine (mine)



Baby, baby, baby oooh

Oh, for you I would have done whatever

And I just can't believe we ain't together

And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you

I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring

And I'm in pieces, baby fix me

And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream

I'm going down, down, down, down

And I just can't believe my first love won't be around



And I'm like

Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,

There was nobody that compared to my baby

And nobody came between us or could ever come above

She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,

She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.

She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and

At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.

She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing

And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...



Baby, baby, baby oooh

Like baby, baby, baby nooo

I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Yeah, yeah never ever ever ever ever
See I never thought that I could walk through fire

I never thought that I could take the burn

I never had the strength to take it higher

Until I reached the point of no return



And there's just no turning back

When your heart's under attack

Gonna give everything I have

It's my destiny



I will never say never, I will fight

I will fight 'til forever, to make it right

Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground

Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never

Ne-never say never

Ne-never say never

Ne-never say never

Never say it, never never say it



I never thought that I could feel this power

I never thought that I could feel this free

I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower

And I'm fast enough to run across the sea



Cause there's just no turning back (oh no)

When your heart's under attack (oh no)

Gonna give everything I have

Cause this is my destiny



I will never say never, I will fight

I will fight 'til forever, to make it right

Whenever you knock me down

I will not stay on the ground

Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up

And never say never



Here we go Guess who?

J Smith and JB, uh huh

I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them

Hold up, aight? I can handle them

Now he's bigger than me, taller than me

And he's older than me and stronger than me

And his arms a little bit longer than me

But he ain't on a JB song with me

I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill

No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove

Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, let's go

I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest

Like David and Goliah, I conquered the giant

So now I got the world in my hand

I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone



I will never say never, I will fight

I will fight 'til forever, to make it right

Whenever you knock me down

I will not stay on the ground

Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up

And never say never

Say never

I will never say never (never say it, never never say it)

Say never

I will fight to forever to make it right

Whenever you knock me down

I will not stay on the ground

Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
